Hello World PWA app
==========

To add your Progressive Web Application (PWA) to your home screen, which is akin to "downloading" it (although technically, it's more like creating a shortcut to the PWA), follow these steps. The process can vary slightly depending on the browser and operating system of your phone.

For Android Devices:
Using Google Chrome or most other browsers on Android:

Open Your PWA in the Browser:

Open the browser on your phone.
Navigate to the URL of your PWA (e.g., https://baogorek.github.io/hello_pwa/).
Access the Browser Menu:

Tap the three dots in the top right corner of the browser to open the menu.
Add to Home Screen:

Look for an option that says “Add to Home screen” and tap it.
You might need to confirm or enter a name for the shortcut.
Shortcut Created:

Once added, your PWA will appear as an icon on your home screen.
Tapping this icon will open the PWA in a standalone window, similar to a native app.
For iOS Devices (iPhone, iPad):
Using Safari on iOS:

Open Your PWA in Safari:

Open Safari on your iOS device.
Go to the URL of your PWA.
Use the Share Icon:

Tap the share icon at the bottom of the Safari window (the square with an arrow pointing out).
Add to Home Screen:

In the share menu, scroll until you find the “Add to Home Screen” option and tap it.
You might need to enter a name for the shortcut.
Shortcut Added:

After adding it, your PWA will appear as an icon on your home screen.
When you tap this icon, your PWA will launch in full-screen mode, providing an app-like experience.
